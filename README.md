# simpleBGC32-source
Beacause the software of simpleBGC32 is unopen-source, however I want to read the IMU data from the board. So I have to develop the project based on the code by 康朝阳 on the Internet.
Based on simpleBGC32 v1.3 board, I have been changed the IO pins configures with the v1.3, and I can read the two IMUs on the board and camera. But the pwm control the motors still some problems to solve, and beacause the time, I can't complete this work. I want someone do it and can make it open-source.
